# ASL Translator Project

## Overview
This project is a real-time American Sign Language (ASL) Translator built using Python. It leverages MediaPipe for hand landmark detection and TensorFlow for gesture classification to enable communication between ASL users and non-signers.

## Features
- Real-time hand gesture detection using MediaPipe.
- Neural network model for accurate ASL gesture classification.
- User-friendly interface to display translated signs.
- Landmark normalization and data preprocessing for enhanced accuracy.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- MediaPipe
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
